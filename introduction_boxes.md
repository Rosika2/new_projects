## Introduction to Gnome Boxes

Gnome Boxes is a user-friendly application for managing virtual machines on Linux systems.
It´s similar to `virt-manager` but it has some differences as well.
It is designed to provide a simplified user interface catering for the tasks of creating, configuring, and running virtual machines 
without requiring all of the knowledge you´d need for running other virtualization concepts (e.g. `virt-manager`).


### Key Features of gnome-boxes

1. Simplified Interface: Gnome Boxes offers a streamlined interface that makes it easy for users to manage virtual machines without dealing with complex configurations.

2. Integration with Gnome Desktop Environment: As the name suggests, Gnome Boxes is tightly integrated with the Gnome desktop environment, providing a seamless experience for Gnome users.
However it should be no problem running Gnome Boxes with other DEs.

3. Quick Setup: With Gnome Boxes, users can quickly set up virtual machines. You may use pre-configured operating system images or ISO files.

4. Snapshot Support: Gnome Boxes supports creating snapshots of virtual machines, allowing users to save and restore the state of their virtual environments. Snapshots can also be created with `virsh` of course.

5. Remote Access: Gnome Boxes allows users to connect to remote virtual machines using protocols like SPICE or VNC.

        virt-manager: Offers a wide range of advanced features for managing virtual machines, storage, networking, and more.

4. Scope:
        Gnome Boxes: Primarily aimed at desktop users who need to run virtual machines for testing, development, or basic tasks.
        virt-manager: Suited for both desktop and server environments, offering an advanced set of management capabilities for virtualization.


### Common Features:

Despite their differences, Gnome Boxes and virt-manager share some common features:

1. Virtual Machine Management: Both tools allow users to create, configure, start, stop, and delete virtual machines.

2. Snapshot Support: Both Gnome Boxes and virt-manager support creating and managing snapshots of virtual machines.
