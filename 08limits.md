### Limitations ogf gnome-boxes ###
The main limitations of gnome-boxes are
 - it can only run one guest VM at a time
 - remote access to a guest VM is impossible  without special tricks
 - one can not setup access to specific host hardware such as usb drive
 - the shared folder option does not work (for us) 

Those limitations do not really affect normal desktop use, because one can 
 - copy single files between host and guest
 - mount a host filesystem in the guest.
